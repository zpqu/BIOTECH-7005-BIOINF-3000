# Introduction

In this practical, we will use a RNA-Seq dataset from a model plant *Arabidopsis thaliana* (Wang et al, 2017, <https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/tpj.13481>). This dataset was initially used for identification of long non-coding RNAs by transcriptome assembly of RNA-Seq.

## Dataset

Due to the the limitation of computing resources in our VM, we will use a subset of raw reads (reads from chromomose 2 of Arabidopsis) from one of three biological replicates sampled from leaf tissue. Here are some informations for Arabidopsis and this RNA-Seq datatset:

- Reference genome build: TAIR10 (<https://www.arabidopsis.org/index.jsp>)
- Number of chromosomes: 5 chromosomes + Chloroplast + Mitochondria
- Genome size: ~135 Mb

- Number of raw reads (pairs): 2,991,799
- Sequencing type: PE125

# Practicals for transcriptome assembly

There are three parts to the transcriptome assembly in this Prac. Please follow the instructions __in order__, because some commands will rely on the results from previous commands. Feel free to talk to tutors/instructors if you have a problem/question.

## Part 1, Setup and data preparation

In this part, we will activate the conda environment and install tools/packages required in this project. We will also create some folders to keep files (including input RNA-Seq raw reads, databases and output files) organised.

### 1.1 Create, activate `conda` environment and install required tools

The first step is to install the `conda transcriptomics_analysis` environment, and we will install several essential tools/packages under this `conda` enviroment. You can learn more about `conda` environment from this [link]{https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html}. This `transcriptomics_analysis conda` environment has most of the tools that we are going to use pre-installed.

After you login to your VM and open the terminal you will see the prompt in the terminal window. This is the prompt in my VM.

```bash
(base) student@bioinf-3000-2022-4:~$
```

Once you are in the terminal window, create the `conda transcriptomics_analysis` environment using following command:

```bash
conda create -n transcriptomics_analysis
```

And then activate the `conda` environment using following command:

```bash
conda activate transcriptomics_analysis
```

Your terminal prompt should become:

```bash
(transcriptomics_analysis) student@bioinf-3000-2022-4:~$
```

Did you see the difference. The `(transcriptomics_analysis)` at the beginning of your prompt indicates that you are in the `transcriptomics_analysis` conda environment.

Then we need to install several tools/packages via conda. Type the following commands in your terminal to install `Trinity`, `GMAP`, `STAR`, `BUSCO` respectively.

```bash
conda install -c bioconda trinity busco star gffread bowtie
```

You may need to press `enter` to confirm the installation.

Once you have all tools installed, you can use following commands to check whether all required tools/packages have been successfully installed in your conda environment.

```bash
conda list
```

After all required tools/packages are successfully installed in your conda environment, we will create some folders to store the files used in this Prac.

### 1.2 Prepare folder structure for the project

For each project, I normally store files at different processing stages in different folders. I put initial input data into a `data` folder, and output files from different processing stages into separate folders in a `results` folder. If there are databases involved, I also create a `DB` folder. I store all scripts in a separate `scripts` folder (we won't use this folder in this Prac).

```bash
mkdir Practical_transcriptomics
cd Practical_transcriptomics
mkdir data DB results
cd results
mkdir 1_QC 2_clean_data 3_denovo_assembly 4_genome_guided_assembly 5_final_assembly
```

The final folder structure for this project will look like this:

```
Practical_transcriptomics/
├── DB
├── data
└── results
    ├── 1_QC
    ├── 2_clean_data
    ├── 3_denovo_assembly
    ├── 4_genome_guided_assembly
    └── 5_final_assembly
```

### 1.3 Raw data and DB

The initial RNA-Seq raw data is stored in your data directory `~/data/Transcriptomics_data/Practicals`.

Copy the raw data to your `data` folder

```bash
cp ~/data/Transcriptomics_data/Practicals/Col_leaf_chr2_R*.fastq.gz ~/Practical_transcriptomics/data/

```

The databases, including Arabidopsis reference genome (TAIR10_chrALL.fa), annotated genes (TAIR10_GFF3_genes.gtf), and BUSCO lineages file (viridiplantae_odb10.2020-09-10.tar.gz) need to be copied to `~/Practical_transcriptomics/DB` and the tarball decompressed and untarred..

```bash
cp ~/data/Transcriptomics_data/Practicals/TAIR10_* ~/Practical_transcriptomics/DB/ 
cp ~/data/Transcriptomics_data/Practicals/viridiplantae_odb10.2020-09-10.tar.gz ~/Practical_transcriptomics/DB/
cd ~/Practical_transcriptomics/DB
tar -zxvf viridiplantae_odb10.2020-09-10.tar.gz
```

Now, all the setup work is done. Let's move to part 2.

## Part 2, QC

In This part, we will use the skills that we learned from the `NGS_practicals` to do QC and trim adaptors and low-quality sequences from our RNA-Seq raw data.

### 2.1 QC for raw reads

The first step is to do QC for the raw reads using fastQC

```bash
cd ~/Practical_transcriptomics/results/1_QC
fastqc -t 2 -o ./ ~/Practical_transcriptomics/data/Col_leaf_chr2_R1.fastq.gz
fastqc -t 2 -o ./ ~/Practical_transcriptomics/data/Col_leaf_chr2_R2.fastq.gz
```

Then we can check the QC report of the raw reads.

### 2.2 Adaptor and low-quality sequence trimming

After we finish the QC for raw reads, we need to trim adaptor and low-quality sequences from the raw reads. The adaptors for this RNA-Seq dataset are Illumina TrueSeq adaptors as `AGATCGGAAGAGCACACGTCTGAACTCCAGTCA` and `AGATCGGAAGAGCGTCGTGTAGGGAAAGAGTGT`.

```bash
cd ~/Practical_transcriptomics/results/2_clean_data
cutadapt -a AGATCGGAAGAGCACACGTCTGAACTCCAGTCA -A AGATCGGAAGAGCGTCGTGTAGGGAAAGAGTGT -o Col_leaf_chr2_R1.clean.fastq.gz -p Col_leaf_chr2_R2.clean.fastq.gz --minimum-length 25 --quality-cutoff 20 ~/Practical_transcriptomics/data/Col_leaf_chr2_R1.fastq.gz ~/Practical_transcriptomics/data/Col_leaf_chr2_R2.fastq.gz
```

Then we can do QC to check the clean reads.

### 2.3 QC for clean reads

```bash
cd ~/Practical_transcriptomics/results/2_clean_data
fastqc -t 2 -o ./ Col_leaf_chr2_R1.clean.fastq.gz
fastqc -t 2 -o ./ Col_leaf_chr2_R2.clean.fastq.gz
```

We can check the QC reports for the clean reads and compare them with the raw reads.

## Part 3, Genome guided transcriptome assembly (Only applicable if there is a reference genome)

In this section, we will do genome guided transcriptome assembly using STAR and StringTie.

### 3.1 Genome mapping using STAR

The first step for genome guided transcriptome assembly is to map RNA-Seq reads to a reference genome. We will use STAR to do this job in this practical (You can also choose other short RNA aligners to do the mapping).

For genome mapping using STAR, we first need to build the genome index.

```bash
cd ~/Practical_transcriptomics/DB
STAR --runThreadN 2 --runMode genomeGenerate --genomeDir ~/Practical_transcriptomics/DB/TAIR10_STAR125 --genomeFastaFiles TAIR10_chrALL.fa --sjdbGTFfile TAIR10_GFF3_genes.gtf --sjdbOverhang 124 --genomeSAindexNbases 12
```

And then, we map the clean reads to the reference genome. The command line for this is a little complicated, it is broken down below so that you can see what it is doing.

```bash
cd ~/Practical_transcriptomics/results/4_genome_guided_assembly
STAR --genomeDir ~/Practical_transcriptomics/DB/TAIR10_STAR125 --readFilesIn ~/Practical_transcriptomics/results/2_clean_data/Col_leaf_chr2_R1.clean.fastq.gz \
~/Practical_transcriptomics/results/2_clean_data/Col_leaf_chr2_R2.clean.fastq.gz --readFilesCommand zcat \
--runThreadN 2 --outSAMstrandField intronMotif --outSAMattributes All \
--outFilterMismatchNoverLmax 0.03 --alignIntronMax 10000 --outSAMtype BAM SortedByCoordinate \
--outFileNamePrefix Col_leaf_chr2. --quantMode GeneCounts
```

You can copy and paste this version.

```bash
cd ~/Practical_transcriptomics/results/4_genome_guided_assembly
STAR --genomeDir ~/Practical_transcriptomics/DB/TAIR10_STAR125 --readFilesIn ~/Practical_transcriptomics/results/2_clean_data/Col_leaf_chr2_R1.clean.fastq.gz ~/Practical_transcriptomics/results/2_clean_data/Col_leaf_chr2_R2.clean.fastq.gz --readFilesCommand zcat --runThreadN 2 --outSAMstrandField intronMotif --outSAMattributes All --outFilterMismatchNoverLmax 0.03 --alignIntronMax 10000 --outSAMtype BAM SortedByCoordinate --outFileNamePrefix Col_leaf_chr2. --quantMode GeneCounts
```

STAR will output multiple files with prefix `Col_leaf_chr2`. To get an idea about the mapping info, you can check `Col_leaf_chr2.final.Log.out`. The mapped reads are stored in a `bam` file called `Col_leaf_chr2.Aligned.sortedByCoord.out.bam`. To view this file in IGV, we need to create an index file.

```bash
cd ~/Practical_transcriptomics/results/4_genome_guided_assembly
samtools index Col_leaf_chr2.Aligned.sortedByCoord.out.bam
```

In next step, we will use this mapped bam file to do genome guided transcriptome assembly.

### 3.2 Assembly using StringTie

The command for genome guided transcriptome assembly is as follows:

```bash
cd ~/Practical_transcriptomics/results/4_genome_guided_assembly
stringtie Col_leaf_chr2.Aligned.sortedByCoord.out.bam -o StringTie.gtf -p 2
```

StringTie only outputs coordinates for assembled transcripts in into the assembled transcripts file. We can get the sequences of the assembled transcripts using a command called `gffread`.

```bash
cd ~/Practical_transcriptomics/results/4_genome_guided_assembly
gffread -w StringTie.fasta -g ~/Practical_transcriptomics/DB/TAIR10_chrALL.fa StringTie.gtf
```

### 3.3 Assessing the assembly quality using BUSCO

As we did before, we can use BUSCO to assess the assembly quality.

```bash
cd ~/Practical_transcriptomics/results/4_genome_guided_assembly
busco -i StringTie.fasta -l ~/Practical_transcriptomics/DB/viridiplantae_odb10 -o BUSCO_StringTie_viridiplantae -m transcriptome --cpu 2
```

BUSCO will output a bunch of files including the information for predicted ORFs (Open Reading Frames) from assembled transcripts and output files from a `blast` search against orthologs. Of these output files, the most important one is the text file called `short_summary_BUSCO_StringTie_viridiplantae.txt`. In  it you will find one summary line that looks like this `C:30.6%[S:22.4%,D:8.2%],F:11.8%,M:57.6%,n:425`. This line summarises the completeness of assembled transcripts, and explanations of these numbers can be found in the same text file after the one line summary.

```
        --------------------------------------------------
        |Results from dataset viridiplantae_odb10         |
        --------------------------------------------------
        |C:30.6%[S:22.4%,D:8.2%],F:11.8%,M:57.6%,n:425    |
        |130    Complete BUSCOs (C)                       |
        |95     Complete and single-copy BUSCOs (S)       |
        |35     Complete and duplicated BUSCOs (D)        |
        |50     Fragmented BUSCOs (F)                     |
        |245    Missing BUSCOs (M)                        |
        |425    Total BUSCO groups searched               |
        --------------------------------------------------
```


## Part 4, De novo transcriptome assembly

So far we have trimmed the adaptor and low-quality sequences from the reads. Next we will do _de novo_ transcriptome assembly using Trinity.

### 4.1 De novo assembly using Trinity

We will use the clean reads as input.

```bash
cd ~/Practical_transcriptomics/results/3_denovo_assembly
Trinity --seqType fq --left ~/Practical_transcriptomics/results/2_clean_data/Col_leaf_chr2_R1.clean.fastq.gz \
--right ~/Practical_transcriptomics/results/2_clean_data/Col_leaf_chr2_R2.clean.fastq.gz \
--output Col_leaf_chr2_trinity --CPU 2 --max_memory 8G --bypass_java_version_check
```

This step will take more than 2 hours, so we will finish here today and let the VM finish the job, and we will come back to run the remaining analyses in Tuesday's Prac.

### 4.2 Get Trinity assembly statistics

All results from Trinity will be stored in the folder of `Col_leaf_chr2_trinity` in the directory `~/Practical_transcriptomics/results/3_denovo_assembly`. It includes a lot of intermediate files and log files created during the Trinity assembly process. The final output file includes all final assembled transcripts and is named `Trinity.fasta`.  

The Trinity package provides a useful utility to summarise the basic assembly statistics.

```bash
cd ~/Practical_transcriptomics/results/3_denovo_assembly
TrinityStats.pl ./Col_leaf_chr2_trinity/Trinity.fasta
```

And you will get output like this:

```

```

This report gives us some basic statistics of the assembled transcripts from Trinity, such as the number of genes and transcripts and length of transcripts.

__Questions: What is the difference between transcripts and genes? Why have we got more transcripts than genes?__

### 4.3 Assessing the assembly quality using BUSCO

After we get the assembled transcripts, we need to find some ways to assess the quality of the assembly, such as the completeness of genes/transcripts. One way that we can check the assembly quality is by using BUSCO (Benchmarking Universal Single-Copy Orthologs, <https://busco.ezlab.org/>). BUSCO provides quantitative measures for the assessment of genome assembly, gene set, and transcriptome completeness, based on evolutionarily-informed expections of gene content from near-universal single-copy orthologs selected from different lineages.

```bash
cd ~/Practical_transcriptomics/results/3_denovo_assembly
busco -i ./Col_leaf_chr2_trinity/Trinity.fasta -l ~/Practical_transcriptomics/DB/viridiplantae_odb10 -o BUSCO_Trinity_viridiplantae -m transcriptome --cpu 2
```

__Questions:__

- What is the short summary of the BUSCO report for the Trinity assembly?
- How many complete orthologs did it find?
- How many duplicated and single copy orthologs did it find?
- Which assembly is better, the genome guided assembly or the `Trinity` assembly?


### 4.4 Align assembled transcripts to the genome (Only applicable if there is a reference genome)

_Arabidopsis_ has a reference genome, therefore we can map the assembled transcripts to the reference genome to get a genomic coordinates file (GTF or GFF format). We will use an aligner called `GMAP` (<http://research-pub.gene.com/gmap/>) to do the genome mapping.

To use `GMAP`, we first need to build the genome index.

```bash
cd ~/Practical_transcriptomics/DB
gmap_build -D ./ -d TAIR10_GMAP TAIR10_chrALL.fa
```

After building the genome index, we can map the assembled transcripts to the reference genome using following commands:

```bash
cd ~/Practical_transcriptomics/results/3_denovo_assembly
gmap -D ~/Practical_transcriptomics/DB/TAIR10_GMAP -d TAIR10_GMAP -t 2 -f 3 -n 1 ./Col_leaf_chr2_trinity/Trinity.fasta > Trinity.gff3
```

This will generate a GFF3 format file, including genomic coordinates for our _de novo_ assembled transcripts, which we can import into IGV for visualisation.

## Part 5, Visualising your assembled transcripts in IGV

After we finish the _de novo_ transcriptome assembly and genome guided transcriptome assembly, we can visualise our results in IGV to check the assembly quality and look for interesting genes/transcripts.

First, we will put all the important final files into one folder.

```bash
cd ~/Practical_transcriptomics/results/5_final_assembly
cp ~/Practical_transcriptomics/results/3_denovo_assembly/Col_leaf_chr2_trinity/Trinity.fasta ./
cp ~/Practical_transcriptomics/results/3_denovo_assembly/Trinity.gff3 ./
cp ~/Practical_transcriptomics/results/4_genome_guided_assembly/StringTie.fasta ./
cp ~/Practical_transcriptomics/results/4_genome_guided_assembly/StringTie.gtf ./
cp ~/Practical_transcriptomics/results/4_genome_guided_assembly/Col_leaf_chr2.Aligned.sortedByCoord.out.bam ./
cp ~/Practical_transcriptomics/results/4_genome_guided_assembly/Col_leaf_chr2.Aligned.sortedByCoord.out.bam.bai ./
```

Then we can check the assembled transcripts by loading the `Trinity.gff3` and `StringTie.gtf` into IGV. We can also load the `bam` file into IGV to check the reads supporting assembled transcripts.
